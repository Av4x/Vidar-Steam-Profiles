# Vidar-Steam-Profiles
These are steam profiles used to communicate with Vidar malware. In 'vidar-steam-profiles-with-username.txt' you will find steam profiles along with the associated (present time) username. While analyzing I noticed that
most of these account's username history contain other IP addresses (some IPs used interchangeably between different accounts) besides their current one. All IPs from both current username as well as past ones are located
inside 'vidar-only-ips.txt'. A list of only steam profiles can be found at 'vidar-only-steam-profiles.txt'.
